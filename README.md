# Webscraping-IpAustralia
This is a project in which I extract data from the official IP registry website of Australia. The website contains information about the owners of IP addresses. I specifically extract a specific section that is the main focus of my search at that moment. The code is written in Python, and the provided .xml file serves as an example of how the extracted data is structured.
The provided .xml file serves as a representative example of the extracted data structure. It demonstrates how the information is formatted and provides insights into the organization and hierarchy of the extracted data.
By leveraging this project, I can gain valuable insights into IP ownership in Australia. This data can be further analyzed to identify trends, patterns, or any other pertinent information that may be useful for various purposes such as research, security, or regulatory compliance.
